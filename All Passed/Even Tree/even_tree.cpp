 * This program offers a solution to the "Even Tree" challenge on the 
 * InterviewStreet website (URL: https://www.interviewstreet.com/challenges/ 
 * dashboard/#problem/4fffc24df25cd). Here is the problem description, verbatim:
 * 
 * ==
 * You are given a tree (a simple connected graph with no cycles).You have to 
 * remove as many edges from the tree as possible to obtain a forest with the 
 * condition that: Each connected component of the forest contains even number 
 * of vertices
 * 
 * Your task is to calculate the number of removed edges in such a forest.
 * 
 * INPUT:
 * The first line of input contains two integers N and M. N is the number of 
 * vertices and M is the number of edges. 2 <= N <= 100. 
 * Next M lines contains two integers ui and vi which specifies an edge of the 
 * tree. (1-based index)
 * 
 * OUTPUT:
 * Print a single integer which is the answer
 * 
 * SAMPLE INPUT:
 * 10 9
 * 2 1
 * 3 1
 * 4 3
 * 5 2
 * 6 1
 * 7 2
 * 8 6
 * 9 8
 * 10 8
 * 
 * SAMPLE OUTPUT:
 * 2
 * 
 * EXPLANATION:
 * On removing the edges (1, 3) and (1, 6), we can get the desired  * result.
 * 
 * ORIGINAL TREE: 
 *       1
 *     / | \
 *    2  3  6
 *   /|  |  |
 *  7 5  4  8
 *          |\
 *          9 10
 * 
 * DECOMPOSED TREE:
 *       1
 *     /    
 *    2  3  6
 *   /|  |  |
 *  7 5  4  8
 *          |\
 *          9 10
 * 
 * Note: The tree in the input will be such that it can always be decomposed 
 * into components containing even number of nodes.
 * == 
 * 
 * This implementation uses two rounds of BFS to solve the problem: one to 
 * determine the size of all subtrees in the graph and another to count the 
 * number of edges we can remove by locating all nodes that serve as the root 
 * node of an even subgraphÂ (that is, a subgraph with an even number of nodes). 
 * Thus, the runtime of the algorithm is just the runtime of BFS, which is 
 * O(n) for a tree, where n is the number of nodes.
